Background:

- Allen Wirfs-Brock's [paper on standards committee participation for new attendees](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
- TC39's documentation on [How to participate in meetings](https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/HEAD/how-to-participate-in-meetings.md)

## Agenda topic rules

Deadline for advancement eligibility: [January 27th, 10:00 PST](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/winter?iso=20240127T10&p0=137&msg=TC39+Submission+deadline&font=sanserif&csz=1)

- <sub>Note: this time is selected to be precisely 10 days prior to the start of the meeting</sub>

1. Proposals not looking to advance may be added at any time; if after the deadline, please always use a pull request so that members are notified of changes. Note: an unmerged PR counts as ‚Äúadded‚Äù for the purposes of this requirement.
1. Proposals seeking feedback at stage 0 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *should* include supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 1 must be added (and noted as such) prior to the deadline, or else delegates may object to advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. Such proposals *must* link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.
1. Proposals looking to advance to stages 2, 3, or 4, as well as other normative changes to the standard or proposals in stage 3 or later looking to achieve consensus, must be added (and noted as such) *along with links to the supporting materials* prior to the deadline, or else delegates may withhold consensus for advancement solely on the basis of missing the deadline.
    1. If the supporting materials change substantially after the deadline, delegates may withhold consensus for advancement, based on the committee‚Äôs judgment.
    1. For urgent normative changes, the committee is expected to be more forgiving of a missed deadline, since there is generally less material to review than in a stage advancement.
    1. Proposals looking to advance to stage 4 *must* link to a pull request into [the spec](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262), since the [process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) requires one.
1. Proposal-based agenda items should be sorted primarily by stage (descending), secondarily by timebox (ascending), and finally by insertion date.

Supporting materials includes slides, a link to the proposal repository, a link to spec text, etc.; essentially, anything you are planning to present to the committee, or that would be useful for delegates to review.

### Schedule constraints

*Schedule constraints should be supplied here as soon as possible, and **at least three days** before the meeting begins so that the Chairs can take them into account when preparing the schedule.*

<!-- DO NOT PUT YOUR CONSTRAINTS HERE! Put them in one of the next sections: either "Normal Constraints" or "Late-breaking Schedule Constraints" -->

<!-- Be specific! Provide a full name, date and time range that they will or will not be available, and which sessions they are trying to prioritize. Satisfaction not guaranteed, but more information is useful. Conflicting constraints honored on a first-come, first served basis. -->

#### Normal Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied more than three days before the meeting should go here -->

- *Function and Object Literal Element Decorators* should come before *Decorated Function Declarations and Hoisting* as it establishes the context for the discussion. *Decorated Function Declarations and Hoisting* may be skipped if *Function and Object Literal Element Decorators* is not adopted at stage 1 &mdash; Ron Buckton
- Guy Bedford will not be available after 12 noon on the afternoon of 8 Feb.
- Jack Works: I'm interested in the following topics (from most important to least important): ESM Phase Imports, "Discard" (void) Bindings, Extractors update, Function and Object Literal Element Decorators, ShadowRealms, collecting user feedback on syntactic proposals, Throw Expressions and Decimal Decimal: Stage 1 update. I'm available on any day, but it is midnight for me. I prefer those topics to be continuously presented (no other topics in the middle). Those topics should not be presented earlier than the scheduled time if possible, otherwise, I may miss it.
- Please don't schedule "Scrub Stage 1 proposals" with any seriousness; it's just something we can do on the fly if we have extra time at the end (which we usually do not).
- Leo Balter and Caridy Pati√±o prefers discussing ShadowRealms on day 3 afternoon or day 2 afternoon. Might not be available for the morning of Day 3 (Thursday).

#### Late-breaking Schedule Constraints

<!-- Constraints supplied less than three days before the meeting should go here -->
